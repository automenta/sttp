This is the working directory. You can work any way you like here.
But it is easier if you can follow the examples and the template
that you can find in `../example/`.

# File name conventions

 - do not use dots to separate words in the file names or you need
   to modify the `.gitignore` rules first.

 - when you use pandoc please refer to the full name of the input
   file in the name of the output file, for example:

        pandoc src/input-file.md -o src/input-file.md.tex

# Convert figures to .eps

Before building the PDF, remember to convert figures to
encapsulated postscript files (.eps) so that LaTeX can make use of
them.

Xfig figures need to be converted for LaTeX. You should install
the transfig program. The [fig2eps] script can also be useful to
generate encapsulated postscript (.eps) easily.

For SVG, inkscape can export to EPS.
