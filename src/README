This is the working directory. You can work any way you like here.
But it is easier if you can follow the examples and the template
that you can find in `../example/`.

# Metadata

It is useful to add metadata files, for instance using YAML
(http://yaml.org), see
http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#extension-yaml_metadata_block

For more information about the bibliography, see
http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#citations or the
`../example/references.yaml` file.

# File name conventions

 - do not use dots to separate words in the file names or you need
   to modify the `.gitignore` rules first.

 - when you use pandoc please refer to the full name of the input
   file in the name of the output file, for example:

        pandoc src/input-file.md -o src/input-file.md.tex

# Convert figures to .eps

Before building the PDF, remember to convert svg files to
encapsulated postscript files (.eps) (this can be done with
inkscape).
