# General Template

The README should be a good starting point to see what
parts a defensive publication needs.

# Metadata

You can create a separate file for metadata of the defensive
publication, like:

    ../example/abstract.yaml

This file contains an abstract and keywords. More information on
how to use it with pandoc, see
<http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#extension-yaml_metadata_block>


Metadata can also be used for bibliography using pandoc's
citeproc, see an example at:

    ../example/references.yaml

For more information to use the bibliography, see
<http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#citations>

# Figures

You can include figures directly in the body of the defensive
publication, but you can also group them together at the end in
a single latex file such as

    ../example/figures.tex

## Flowcharts

### Using LaTeX TikZ

The TikZ package can be used to create flowcharts. An example can
be found at:

    ../example/flowchart.tex

More resources for TikZ on <http://www.texample.net/tikz/>


### Using Xfig

Xfig can also be used to create flowcharts. An example can be
found at:

    ../example/flowchart.fig


## Scalable figures

TODO

Inkscape tempaltes other Xfig templates?

## Convert figures to .eps

Before building the PDF, remember to convert figures to
encapsulated postscript files (.eps) so that LaTeX can make use of
them.

Xfig figures need to be converted for LaTeX. You should install
the transfig program. The [fig2eps] script can also be useful to
generate encapsulated postscript (.eps) easily.

For SVG, inkscape can export to EPS.
