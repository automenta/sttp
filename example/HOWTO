# General Template

The README should be a good starting point to see what
parts a defensive publication needs.

# Metadata

You can create a separate file for metadata of the defensive
publication, like:

    ../example/abstract.yaml

This file contains an abstract and keywords. More information on
how to use it with pandoc, see
<http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#extension-yaml_metadata_block>


Metadata can also be used for bibliography using pandoc's
citeproc, see an example at:

    ../example/references.yaml

For more information to use the bibliography, see
<http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#citations>

# Figures

You can include figures directly in the body of the defensive
publication, but you can also group them together at the end in
a single latex file such as

    ../example/figures.tex

## Flowcharts

### Using LaTeX TikZ

The TikZ package can be used to create flowcharts. An example can
be found at:

    ../example/flowchart.tex

More resources for TikZ on <http://www.texample.net/tikz/>


### Using Xfig

Xfig can also be used to create flowcharts. An example can be
found at:

    ../example/flowchart.fig


## Scalable figures

TODO

Inkscape tempaltes other Xfig templates?
