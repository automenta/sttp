Your defensive publication should give an overview of the
technical problem and the existing solutions if any, before
describing in more details what your solution is and how it works
so that another programmer would be able to make an implementation.

# Title of Defensive Publication

The idea is to get the patent examiner’s attention when reviewing
a patent application relevant to the system disclosed in your
publication. 

1. If the system is solving a well known, general problem in an
   innovative way, it is probably better to emphasize your
   solution in abstract terms so that further patent applications
   using identical or or similar concepts would be preempted by
   your publication. 
2. If the system is solving a more specific problem, it is
   probably better to emphasize the problem so that further patent
   applications aiming at solving the same problem will be
   compared with your publication. 

# Abstract or Introduction

The abstract should give a clear idea what area of technology your
solution relates to and give an overview of what your solution is.

1. Briefly describe the technological area in which your solution
   operates and point out specific issues that are hard to solve
   or unsatisfactorily solved that are related to your solution.
    a. Give examples of existing solutions to reflect the state of
    the art in this area of technology
    b. Briefly describe the trends or practices in this area of
    technology or other areas of technology that create
    opportunities for new or better solutions.
2. Include a short overview of your technology by briefly
   describing how the solution works without giving too many
   details on implementation.
3. Provide context:  
    a. If your publication is strongly related to one or more
    existing patents, identify them in the abstract and explain
    how they are related to your publication.
    b. Briefly state where this technology could be used? (i.e.
    mobile devices, gaming, automotive)

## Keywords

A list of keywords to make the document easier to search. Pick around five
tags.

# Problem/ Opportunity

This section helps to provide context as to the defensive
publication. This is useful to give input on what **the state of the
art** is in relation to your defensive publication.

Use this section to provide: 

1. Explanations and background of the problem being solved
2. Description of the existing solutions
3. Description on the current trends followed in this area or in
   other technologies that are also applicable to this problem
4. Emphasis on what makes your solution stand out compared to
   existing solutions


# Description of your solution

This section should be clear and exact so that a “person having
skill in the art a.k.a. PHOSITA” (e.g. another programmer) can
implement and make use of the system described in your
publication.

1. Description of how this invention/ idea works
    
    It should be a few paragraphs of text. Avoid domain specific
    language. Say “database” instead of “MySQL” for example.

2. Why this is better/ more efficient/ needed over what is currently available. 

In order to adequately describe an invention, be sure to discuss
how each component works within the method/system by breaking the
invention down into steps and diagrams. Examples of potential
applications and references to compare how this invention improves
on what was previously available should also be included. 

# Steps to create the invention

Publications and patents relevant to software will typically
consist of several steps. Each step should be described in detail
for this portion. 

1. Break down each component and describe how each component works
   with the overall system
2. List each step in the process and describe how each step is
   completed. 

*Each of the system components should be described exhaustively*

# Examples

If there are any alternate uses for this invention, be sure to
include them. These are potential applications that have yet to
be implemented. 

# References

If you have references to for example a publication in
a scientific journal, technical report, USENET posting, or print
magazine, include it here with as much information as possible
(publication number, ISBN, ISSN, etcetera). Please make sure they
are clearly marked in the rest of the document.

# Diagrams

1. Illustrate how components interact 
2. Show the overall process

This can be a flow chart, a network diagram, etc.
