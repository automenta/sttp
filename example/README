# General Template

The file template.pdf should be a good starting point to see what
parts a defensive publication needs. You can see the source for
template.pdf in:

 -  template.md
 -  footer.md

# Metadata

You can create a separate file for metadata of the defensive
publication, such as:

    abstract.yaml

This file contains an abstract and keywords. More information on
how to use it with pandoc, see
http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#extension-yaml_metadata_block


Metadata can also be used for bibliography, see an example at:

    references.yaml

For more information to use the bibliography, see
http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#citations

# Figures

You can include figures directly in the body of the defensive
publication, but you can also group them together at the end in
a single latex file such as

    figures.tex

## Flowcharts

### Using LaTeX TikZ

The TikZ package can be used to create flowcharts. An example can
be found at:

    flowchart.tex

More resources for TikZ on http://www.texample.net/tikz/


### Using Xfig

Xfig can also be used to create flowcharts. An example can be
found at:

    flowchart.fig


## Scalable figures

TODO

Inkscape tempaltes other Xfig templates?
