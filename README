Get Started
===========

To start with your defensive publication, have a look in the
`example/` directory for other defensive publications example and
for the template documents. Then, go write in the `src/`
directory.

You can find examples of defensive publications along with
guidelines at:
<http://www.defensivepublications.org/defensive-pubs-examples>


Build instructions
==================

Dependencies: 

  - [pandoc] 
  - LaTeX with XeTeX support
  - [pandoc]-citeproc (recommended)

You can write your defensive publication in any format handled by
[pandoc] such as Markdown, reStructuredText, Mediawiki, Org-mode,
OPML. Please put them in the `src/` directory. More information
can be found about that in the `src/README`.

To build the PDF

1. Translate the defensive publication source files to LaTeX, for
   example:

    pandoc src/intro.md src/main.md src/appendix.md -o defpubTitle.tex --template src/template.tex --standalone

You can also define variables and more options of the `pandoc`
command above. 

If you include complex figures:
    
    --variable complex-figures

If you also want to produce a bibliography, we recommend using
pandoc-citeproc with a `src/references.yaml` file, then you need
to include in the `pandoc` command:

    --filter pandoc-citeproc src/references.yaml
