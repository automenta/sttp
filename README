Get Started
===========

To write your defensive publication, have a look in the `example/`
directory for other defensive publications example and for the
template documents.


Build instructions
==================

Dependency: LaTeX with XeTeX support

Before running
    
    xelatex defpub-title.tex

You need to convert your content source files to input that can be
handled by LaTeX. More precisely you need to:

  - convert src/source-file.md in a .tex input file
    src/source-file.md.tex
    
    this can be done easily with

        pandoc src/source-files.md -o src/source-files.md.tex --variable lang=english
    
  - convert svg files to encapsulated postscript files (.eps)
    (this can be done with inkscape)



Todo list
=========
 
 - make a script to set up variables such as
    - TITLE
    - PROJECT
    - URL
    - FEATURE (optional)
    - DESCRIPTION
    - TAGS
    - source-file

 - make a script to build
    - markdown to tex files (if any)
    - svg to eps
    - master latex file
